## Last Week's Accomplishments

After finding out that I can't use the authentication middleware in the controller file, I rewrote the exports.destroy to correct for this.
I also opened a pull request with my changes to the excused absence model.


## This Week's Plan

I will bug Alex to review my pull request and give me more issues to resolve.

## Anything Blocking?
