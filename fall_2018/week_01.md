## Last Week's Accomplishments

There were plans to meet with Alex and the rest of the Observatory team over the weekend, but everyone was busy with the career fair and nothing happened.

## This Week's Plan

The plan for this week is to identify bugs in Observatory and work toward fixing them

## Anything Blocking?

I'm unfamiliar with the structure of Observatory, nor do I know how to find out what needs to be worked on
