## Last Week's Accomplishments

I met with Jonathan Caicedo (a former member of the observatory team), and he helped me resolve bugs in my code for the ExcusedAbsence destroy function.
It turns out you can access the user authentication libraries from within the controller, which is way simpler and cleaner than what I was trying to do before.

## This Week's Plan

Alex gave me a list of tasks to complete in the ExcusedAbsence model. I'll keep working on those.

## Anything Blocking?

nope!
