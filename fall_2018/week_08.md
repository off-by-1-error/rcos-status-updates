## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I wrote exports.deny, the controller fuctions which allows observatory admins to deny excused absence requests. I also updated the routes in index.js
to use the exports.approve and exports.deny functions. I also wrote the documentation for exports.deny

## This Week's Plan

This week, I'll work more on updating the exports.update function, and make it so that users can only update specific attributes of their excused absence 
depending on whether or not they have admin status.

## Anything Blocking?

nothing blocking!
