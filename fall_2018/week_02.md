## Last Week's Accomplishments

I got my first issue assigned. I resolved it and created a pull request with Alex's help.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on making the other necessary files for the room model and learning to test them using Postman

## Anything Blocking?

I'm sick and have lots of other homework and I'm horrifically unfamiliar with javascript and mongo but otherwise everything is fine
